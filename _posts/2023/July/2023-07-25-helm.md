# Helm

## Basic commands

```bash
# List helm repositories
helm repo list

# Search for a specific repo
# Can be combined with --versions flag to show all available versions
helm search repo filebeat

# Get notes for a specific release
helm get notes -n <namespace> <release-name>

# Check which values were used for a specifc release (Shows user supplied values only and not default values for this chart)
# To get all the values you can pass --all flag
helm get values -n <namespace> <release-name>

# Check the definition files used to deploy the release to the cluster
helm get manifest -n <namespace> <release-name>

# Add bitnami repo and install nginx chart
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install nginx bitnami/nginx --version 15.1.1 -n helm

# Check the previous revisions of a specific release
helm history <release-name>

# Rollback to specific release version
helm rollback <release-name> <version>

# Install specific release if it doesn't or upgrade the existing one if it does exist
# You can wait for pods to become ready via --wait flag and specify exact timeout (default is 300 seconds) using --timeout
helm upgrade --install nginx --set service.port=8080 bitnami/nginx
```

- When helm marks a release as failed, it does so only if Kubernetes rejects the manifests, meaning that for some specific cases you can have a release with a status `Deployed` which is broken on the resource level (ex: If supplied image registry is wrong, it won't be validated and when it's time to pull the image you'll get **imagePullbackOff**)

## [Chart creation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/)
```bash
# Uses nginx by default
helm create <chart-name>

.
├── Chart.yaml
├── charts
├── templates
│   ├── NOTES.txt
│   ├── _helpers.tpl
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── hpa.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── serviceaccount.yaml
│   └── tests
│       └── test-connection.yaml
└── values.yaml
```
- The `Chart.yaml` requires 3 keys
  1. apiVersion: v1 for helm2 and v2 for helm 3
  2. name: Chart title
  3. version: Chart version (Follows semantic versioning)
- `_helpers.tpl` is used to define a template that can be embedded in another template

## Chart Packaging
```bash
# Creates a tar 
helm package <chart-directory>

# Then can be used as
helm install <release-name> <tar-file>
```

## [Playing with helm built in objects](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/builtin_objects/)
- `NOTES.txt` is not validated against Kubernetes API which makes it a good choice for this use case
- So any helm template code can be written here and it will be rendered (use with `--dry-run` flag) `helm install <name> --dry-run .`

{% raw %}
```
Chart name is {{ .Chart.Name }}
Chart version is {{ .Chart.Version }}
AppVersion is {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}
Release Namespace is {{ .Release.Namespace }}
Is this a new installation ? {{ .Release.IsInstall }}
Is this an upgrade ? {{ .Release.IsUpgrade }}
The version of kubernetes on the cluster is {{ .Capabilities.KubeVersion }}
```
{% endraw %}

## Functions
- Helm includes the [sprig library](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)

### toYaml
- Converts the input passed to it into a valid YAML
- When any value is passed to helm, it is processed by **go** which doesn't know about YAML (So the rendering will be for maps)
- The output for resources section without `toYaml` is as follows

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Without toYaml
resources: map[limits:map[cpu:100m memory:128Mi] requests:map[cpu:100m memory:128Mi]]

# With toYaml
resources: {{ toYaml .Values.resources | nindent 2 }}
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
```
{% endraw %}

### nindent Vs indent
- Both are used to add whitespaces to the beginning of the YAML
- If used with {% raw %}`{{- }}`{% endraw %} then the difference is
  - indent will result in the first line being prepended to the previous YAML line
  - nindent will insert a new line to the start of the output and keep the YAML structure valid
